# LEGAL NOTICE & INTEROPERABILITY STATEMENT

## Project Status

This project is an independent, community-driven hobby tool created for interoperability and preservation purposes within the Arma modding ecosystem.

It is provided free of charge for non-commercial use. Optional donations are accepted only to support ongoing development and infrastructure costs. Donations do not grant access to paid features, builds, or services.

## Independent Implementation

This software is an original implementation developed through:

* observation of file behavior
* analysis of files generated by official tools
* binary compatibility testing
* publicly available documentation
* clean-room reverse engineering for interoperability where required

No proprietary source code from Bohemia Interactive or any third party is included in this repository.

No decompiled source code from proprietary applications is distributed with this project.

## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this tool is to enable interoperability with existing community-created content and legacy terrain data by:

* reading and writing compatible file formats
* allowing migration and preservation of community-created assets
* supporting non-commercial modding and research

This project does not:

* include original game assets
* include proprietary SDK components
* bypass copy protection or DRM
* modify or patch official tools
* enable piracy or unauthorized content extraction

## Intellectual Property

All trademarks, product names, and game titles are the property of their respective owners.

This project is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by Bohemia Interactive a.s.

Any references to game titles or tools are for compatibility and informational purposes only.

## Reverse Engineering and Interoperability

Where file format compatibility required deeper analysis, reverse engineering was performed solely for the purpose of achieving interoperability with legally obtained software and user-created content.

Under applicable EU and international interoperability provisions, such analysis is limited to what is necessary to ensure compatibility and does not include redistribution of proprietary code or assets.

All implementations contained in this repository are original and written from scratch.

## Third-Party Libraries

This project may use third-party open-source libraries.
Each library remains under its respective license.
See accompanying license files or documentation for details.

## Non-Commercial Use

This tool is intended for personal, educational, archival, and community modding use only.

Users are responsible for ensuring their usage complies with the licenses and terms of any games, tools, or assets they use alongside this software.

## Contact and Concerns

If any rights holder believes this project unintentionally infringes on their intellectual property, please open an issue or contact the maintainer. Good-faith concerns will be reviewed and addressed promptly.
